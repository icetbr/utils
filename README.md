# Utils: useful functions for my personal projects

Used for the purposes of **learning** and to a minor degree, **efficiency**. No reinvention of the wheel intended.

## Learning
I use a minimal implemention that suits my current problem. When they become insufficient or present a bug, I **study the reasons** and look online for solutions, usualy exploring the source code of other npm libraries.

## Efficiency
The minimal code also helps with **performance** and reduces **cognitive load** when trying to analyze the source code.

This package is meant to be used with **tree shaking** or some automatic copy/pasting perhaps, if size is really an issue.
